# HAIKU GENERATOR ++ 

This program uses a set of predefined haiku verses to generate haiku poetry! Explore the canvas by clicking around- 

Clicking a line will change it into a new line.
Clicking the background of the poem will chage the color.
Hovering over a line makes it grow!

There is an itty-bitty "new" button which will write a brand new poem alltogether!
