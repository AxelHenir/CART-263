## DESPERATELY DESIRING DRIFT

The world is boring. The only thrill in life is drifting. We all drift but it's only those who connect with the drift, who feel the drift, who live, eat, sleep and breathe the drift who will truly know life's purpose. Drift away your sorrow, even if there are people who say you can't. Show them that drifitng is the one true way of life. Your desire to drift is insurmountable and you will show them- you will drift as the world urges you to. 

In this program, you will control a car (white car) and you must simply drift for as long as you can.

Control your car with:
W: Accelerate
S: Brake
A/D : Steer left/right

Don't let your fuel run out and dont let the cops get you.
