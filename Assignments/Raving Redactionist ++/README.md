# RAVE REDACTOR (++)

### Hello and welcome to the rave.

You must be new here. Well, let me show you the ropes. At this club, you're gonna be our *redactor*. A redactor's job is simple: keep the rave **SAFE**. You need to keep an eye out for suspicious activity and investigate anything fishy. To investigate, click on the thing you wanna investigate. You'll shine a light on them, exposing them and their actions. We please ask that you *leave the ravers be* if you don't see anything suspcious. If you catch a raver doing something bad, you know what to do. **REDACT 'EM.**
