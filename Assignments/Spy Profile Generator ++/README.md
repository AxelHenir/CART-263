# E3: SPY PROFILE GENERATOR AND DATABASE

Program by: Alex Henri

With this program, you can generate fictitious spy profiles with data pulled from online JSON files or by manually entering all data.
Your profile will be saved automatically between site visits. From the homepage, press 1, 2 or 3 for the various login and generation options.
When viewing the profile, you can burn the document with B. Burning the profile clears it from your stored data, erasing it forever. Pressing R 
returns you tot he homepage to login again. Upon requesting to login, you must provide the name and password of your spy profile.
