# 1 MILLION

### Results in under a second

One of my favourite things about generative art is the instantaneousness of it. The ability to view hundreds of iterations of your design idea is a major advantage in selecting strong pieces of work. Another one of my favourite things is the ability for generative art to answer the question "what if?". While working, I often follow tangential thoughts to explore other possibilities. I think to myself, "Nice. But what about something more?". Implementing those ideas is often simple enough to do and you can see (and compare) your results really quickly. On my journey to improve my generative art capabilities, I present this project: 1 Million. 

### 1 Million is about experimenting

Generative art is one of the most experimenting-friendly forms of art and I want to encourage that experimental nature in my project. On each page, you can interact with a basic generative system. Generating results is as easy as pressing a single button. Using the control pannel, you can explore how each input affects the art generation. Save your favourite outputs to keep for yourself or share with others. My intention is for you to have fun and explore the system and watch how small changes in parameters can yield wildly different results every time.
