# 1 MILLION PIXELS..

..and way more possibilities. 1 Million is a project about exploring the many possibilities of generative art on the 1000 x 1000 pixel canvas. 

### Results in under a second

One of my favourite things about generative art is the instantaneousness of it. The ability to view hundreds of iterations of your design idea is a major advantage in selecting strong pieces of work. Another one of my favourite things is the ability for generative art to answer the question "what if?". While working, I often follow tangential thoughts to explore other possibilities. I think to myself, "Nice. But what about something more?". Implementing those ideas is often simple enough to do and you can see (and compare) your results really quickly. On my journey to improve my generative art capabilities, I present this project: 1 Million. 

### 1 Million is about experimenting

Generative art is one of the most experimenting-friendly forms of art and I want to encourage that experimental nature in my project. On each page, the user can interact with a basic generative system which demonstrates some fundamental principles of art. Using the control pannel, the user can explore how they affect the art generation and can save their favourite outputs. If a user really gets a good understanding of the controls, they wield the ability to produce thousands of iterations of their favourite designs in search of particularly interesting ones.
